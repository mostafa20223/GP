# Imaging Mass Spectrometry in Detecting Tumor Heterogeneity

# Abstract

# Introduction
Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) is a technology that simultaneously provides the spatial distribution of hundreds of biomolecules directly from tissue lead to minimal loss of histological information. The most common technique used for it is “Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI)”. Accordingly, the same tissue section can be histologically assessed and registered to the MSI dataset and be accessed using any programming language (e.g. MATLAB, Python, etc.). This high cellular specificity is behind the increasing popularity of MSI in cancer research and its proven ability to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

MSI provides untargeted spatial-molecular information necessary to uncover molecular Intratumor heterogeneity. The challenge has been to identify those tumor subpopulations that drive patient outcomes within the highly complex datasets (hyper-dimensional data, Intratumor heterogeneity, and patient variation). Here we report an automatic, unbiased pipeline to nonlinearly map the hyper-dimensional data into a 3D space, and identify molecularly distinct, clinically relevant tumor subpopulations. We demonstrate this pipeline’s ability to uncover subpopulations statistically associated with patient survival in primary tumors of gastric cancer and with metastasis in primary tumors of breast cancer. |
