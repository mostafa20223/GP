Clinical_data: contains clinical data for each sample
goodlist: tells for each pixel in the unfolded MSI_data_cube if it is a MSI spectrum or not
HE_image: histological image for each sample
MSI_data_cube: contains the spectral data in the z-dimension; not every pixel is associated to a MSI spectrum (see goodlist)
peak_list: contains information about the peaks (mz value, average intensity, lower boundary, upper boundary)
pixel_to_sample_ID: tells for each pixel in the MSI_data_cube to which sample_ID it belongs; can be linked to sample_ID of Clinical_data table
x: width of dataset in pixels
y: height of dataset in pixels
z: number of peaks (z-dimension of MSI_data_cube)
